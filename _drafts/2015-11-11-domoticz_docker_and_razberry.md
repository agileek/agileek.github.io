Today I'm going to test a new communication system, the Z-Wave.

I bought a [RaZberry][razberry] and plugged it on my raspberryPi which already have a domoticz running in docker.

In my [previous article][previous_article], I explain how I managed to get domoticz running in a docker container on my raspberry pi B+.
