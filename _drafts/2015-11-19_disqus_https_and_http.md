The comments on my blog are powered by Disqus, and it works really well. Almost really well, actually.

I'm using github pages (Which serve HTTP and HTTPS pages) and I wanted to force to HTTPS.

Why HTTPS ?

 - [Firefox starts to deprecate non secure HTTP][firefox_http]
 - [Https as a ranking signal on google][google_https]
 - [Let's Encrypt is trusted!][letsencrypt][^1]

###Â Let's do it

I found this gist to force the HTTPS redirection

{% gist konklone/9968713 ssl-redirect.html %}

[^1]: Ok, this is not relevant here since I'm using GitHub's certificates, but Let's Encrypt is just too huge to not talk about. I will soon write an article about it.
