## Twelve-Factor Application

If you don't know about the 12 factor applications, I suggest you [read this first.][12factor]

> The twelve-factor app is a methodology for building software-as-a-service apps

During my different missions, I found that these guidelines are wonderful for building and deploying software.

I eventualy came up with a checklist I use on my clients' projects in order to assess the team's maturity level, and track what can be done to improve the application.

I released it on [github][12factor_checklist] and you can find the html version below.

{% endraw %}

This is of course just a scaffolder, I hope you will find it useful.
