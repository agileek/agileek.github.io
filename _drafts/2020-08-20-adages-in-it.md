## Adages in IT

Surely one of the most famous "law" in IT is moore's law. But as you read and learn about computer science, you realise that a lot of people have stated differents "laws", "adages".
This article will try to regroup them all.

### Moore's law

> [Moore's law][moore] is the observation that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit (IC) doubles about every two years

### Conway's law

> [Conway's law][conway] is an adage stating that organizations design systems that mirror their own communication structure

### Brooks's law

> [Brooks's law][brooks] is an observation about software project management according to which "adding manpower to a late software project makes it later"

### Hofstadter’s Law

> [Hofstadter's Law][hofstadter]: It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's Law.

### Parkinson’s Law

> [Parkinson's law][parkinson] is the adage that "work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion"

### Berard’s Law

> [Berard’s Law][berard]: Walking on water and developing software from a specification are easy if both are frozen

### Humphrey’s Law

> [Humphrey’s Law][humphrey]: The user of the software won’t know what she wants until she sees the software

### Ziv’s Law

> [Ziv's Law][ziv]: Specifications will never be fully understood 

### Wegner's Lemma

> [Wegner's Lemma][wegner][^wegner]: It is impossible to fully specify or test an interactive system designed to respond to external inputs

### Langdon’s Lemma

> [Langdon’s Lemma][langdon]: Software evolves more rapidly as it approaches chaotic regions

### Medinilla’s Law for Software Contracts

> [Medinilla’s Law][medinilla]: The 80 000 lines of code won’t fit into a 20-page contract.

### Trivier's third law

> Trivier's third law[^trivier] is an adage stating that every beta environment will be used for production, and every development environment will be used for beta. This law is recursive.
